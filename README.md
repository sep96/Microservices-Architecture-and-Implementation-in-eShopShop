# Microservices Architecture and Implementation in eShopShop
In our EshopShop repository, we've implemented a comprehensive set of features, spanning from Catalog and Basket microservices to Discount and Ordering components. This includes technologies such as ASP.NET Core, MongoDB, Redis, Grpc, MassTransit, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL. The API Gateway Ocelot orchestrates the communication between microservices, while the WebUI ShoppingApp Microservice provides a user interface with ASP.NET Core, Bootstrap 4, and Razor. Resilience is ensured through IHttpClientFactory, Polly, and ancillary containers like Portainer and pgAdmin, all encapsulated in a Dockerized environment. Our codebase reflects best practices, cross-cutting implementations, and a resilient architecture, making 'run-aspnetcore-microservices' a masterpiece of innovation and collaboration in the realm of microservices
